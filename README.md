# A Template for Academic Writing Projects

The repository contains a template for writing NLP/ML papers (using latex).
By no mean one could write a great article by filling a template,
but we hope this project could help less experienced researchers
to grasp key aspects of an academic paper.

In the template, we try to give a detailed TODO list for each paper section 
(see texts in `docs/antnlp-tawp.pdf`),
a workflow for a new writing project,
and a flavor of using latex packages.


## Files and Directories

Suppose your project's name is "antnlp-tawp".
- `antnlp-tawp/docs`: your latex source files. We use `\input` commands in the main tex file `antnlp-tawp.tex` 
to facilitate collaborative writing.
- `antnlp-tawp/images`: the images (prefer pdf format) used in your project. You may have nested directories 
if some images are generated by other programs (e.g., source codes of matplotlib).
- `antnlp-tawp/supplementary`: your latex source files for the supplementary.

Instead of "fig1.pdf, fig2.pdf, paper.tex, my-paper.tex"
we suggest naming the files properly (e.g., "pr-curve.pdf", "inorder-dep-parsing.tex").


## A Workflow

When you start a new paper, we suggest going with the following steps
1. list the motivations (e.g., problem importance/challenges) in the _introduction section_. 
It helps you to build a complete picture of your paper. 
1. list experiments.
1. draw the key figures of your model. It helps you to organize the _approach section_.
1. write _approach section_.
1. write _introduction_ and _abstract_.
1. write _experiments_.
1. write _related work_.
1. write _conclusion_.

The workflow should starts at least 1 month before your deadline.

## Other Suggestions

- latex software: texlive. To be friendly to unicodes, we recommend compiling with xelatex.
- use git
- latex packages
    - equations: `IEEEeqnarray` package 
    - tables: avoid vertical lines
- figures
    - Mac: keynote + LaTeXiT
    - Windows: ppt + kLatexFormula
    - Linux: wps+`images/latex2emf.py` (a linux version of  kLatexFormula is available.
      However, the current version of linux wps can not directly import emf file from clipboard.
      We still need to do the import job manually.)
